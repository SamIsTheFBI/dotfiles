## Wallpapers that give nice color palette with Pywal

In my opinion these images give a nice colorscheme with pywal. If using my dotfiles, dwm and st build, open this directory with `sxiv` and press `control+x control+w` for setting the selected image as wallpaper as well as use its color palette in dwm & st. Rofi and dunst are also themed with it. You can easily modify those colors in `Xresources` and `theme.rasi/dunstrc` for rofi/dunst.
